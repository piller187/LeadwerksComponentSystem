Title: Example of a simple JSON file

Here is an example of a simple JSON project file that will create a GameObject

and attach it to an Entity named "Player". It will also create two components 

called "Input" and "Control". Input will handle user actions for moving the

player and Control will do the actual moving. The Input will fire a Move event

the user hits a key desired for movement. The Controller has an Action for 

moving. So what we want to do is hooking up the Input event Move to the 

Controller Move action. Same goes for jumping. 

(start code)
{
	"gameobjects": 
	[
		{
			"name": "Player",
			"poststart": "
self.entity:SetShadowMode(0)
self.entity:SetCollisionType(Collision.Character)
self.entity:SetPickMode(0)
local mat = Material:Load('Materials/Effects/Invisible.mat')
self.entity:SetMaterial(mat)
mat:Release()"
			"persistent": "true",
			"folder": "",
			"values": 
			[
				{
					"name": "moveSpeed",
					"value": "2",
					"type": "int"
				},
				{
					"name": "jumpForce",
					"value": "4",
					"type": "int"
				}
			],
			"messages": 
			[
			],
			"components": 
			[
				{
					"name": "Input",
					"path": "Scripts/Components/Input.lua"
				},
				{
					"name": "Control",
					"path": "Scripts/Components/Control.lua"
				}
			],
			"hookups": 
			[
				{
					"source": "Input",
					"source_event": "Move",
					"destination": "Controller",
					"destination_action": "Move",
					"arguments": "",
					"filter": ""
				},
				{
					"source": "Input",
					"source_event": "Jump",
					"destination": "Controller",
					"destination_action": "Jump",
					"arguments": "",
					"filter": ""
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
(end)

When you then run your Leadwerks program first time using the LcsLoader all

files needed will be created, which means Scripts/Components/Input.lua and

Scripts/Components/Control.lua. The Player GameObjet is created in runtime and 

wont see that and does not need to. It will contains the components involved 

and handle event messages sent between the components
